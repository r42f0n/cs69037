in   L1(R>0;R)?
(b) Show   that

Hint: Use   Example 5.2.19–2.
Exercise 5.3.5: Consider   four   functions   f1   ,   f2   ,   f3   ,   f4 :   R   → R   satisfying

Answer   the   following   questions.
(a) For   each   of   the   transforms   FCC(f1   ),   FCC(f2   ),   FCC(f3   ),   and   FCC(f4   ),   indicate   whether   it   exists   in   the   sense   that

for   a   ∈   {1, 2,   3,   4}.
(b) For   each   of   the   transforms   FCC(f1   ),   FCC(f2   ),   FCC(f3   ),   and   FCC(f4   ),   indicate   whether   it   is   continuous.

Table   1.

Exercise 6.1.1: In   Table 1 are   given   plots   of   three   discrete-time   functions   defined   on   Z and their   DCFT’s.   You   are   not told which   function   goes with   which   DCFT.   Without   doing   any   computations,   indicate   which   function   in   the   left   column   goes   with   which   DCFT   in the   right   column.
Exercise 6.1.2: Prove   Proposition 6.1.9. 
Exercise 6.1.5: Find   a   function   f      ∈   ℓ2   (Z(∆);C)   such   that   the   function   FDC(f)   is   not   continuous.
